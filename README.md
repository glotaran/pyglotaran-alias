# pyglotaran-alias

Convenience module which allows to use `pyglotaran` as an alias in the CLI and imports, when working with [pyglotaran](https://github.com/glotaran/pyglotaran).

Since the python implementation of glotaran was renamed to pyglotaran to prevent ambiguity, about which glotaran was used,
at times one might be tempted to use `import pyglotaran` instead of `import glotaran`.

## Usage

```python
import pyglotaran
from pyglotaran import

```
